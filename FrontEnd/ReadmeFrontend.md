# WebServer FrontEnd

This folder contains the frontend part of the WebServer project, built using **Bootstrap 5**. It provides the user interface for the backend server implemented in Java Spring Boot.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** All pages are fully responsive thanks to Bootstrap.

- **Home Page:** Main landing page with project introduction.

- **Admin Dashboard:** Admin panel connected to backend authentication.

- **About Page:** Information about the project and author.

- **Structured Folder Layout:** Organized for scalability and maintainability.

- **JavaScript Integration:** Prepared to connect with backend endpoints via `main.js`.
